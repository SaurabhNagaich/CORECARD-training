There are data coming to my system from multiple sources MySQL, logs and including occasional files uploads.
The data comes both static and dynamic way i.e. real-time data as well as batch data.
I have to build a system which combines all these data inputs and prepares analytics over it.
PySpark is just a Python wrapper around Apache Spark which is written in Scala programming language.
